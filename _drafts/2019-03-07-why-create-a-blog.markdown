A few weeks ago, I started participating in an initiative at work to help facilitate knowledge transfer between the cyber pros at work. &nbsp;While preparing for one of our sessions, I realized that I was yet again, re-collecting information about topics that I've learned/shared numerous times in the past.

Like most cyber folks, I spend a ton of time learning various things related to cybersecurity, coding, computer systems, etc. Obviously, constant learning is hugely beneficial and essentially a requirement for our field; however, I frequently find myself re-learning things over and over again. This often requires spending loads of time researching and trying to find resources that I long ago lost. &nbsp;

Hopefully, by blogging about the things I learn, as I learn them, my retention will increase and I'll have created a one-stop-shop resource for reference. &nbsp;A secondary goal of this site is to provide a centralized place for notes on the topics we discuss in our knowledge transfer sessions at work. Lastly and most importantly, I am writing this blog as a way to give back to the community and help others. Enjoy!
